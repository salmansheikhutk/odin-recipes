    <img src="../images/pizza.webp">
    <p>This 2-ingredient pizza dough is fast and easy to make and tastes great! Greek yogurt is the secret ingredient and baking the crust at a higher temperature is the key to making this the perfect pizza. It doesn't get any easier than this folks. Brush dough with olive oil, add your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-rising flour: You'll need 1 Â½ cups of self-rising flour. If you only have all-purpose flour on hand, you can make a DIY version with just a few ingredients.</li>
        <li>Yogurt: Plain Greek yogurt holds the dough together and ensures a tender texture. Make sure you get authentic Greek yogurt and not Greek-style yogurt.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix Ingredients: Mix the flour and yogurt until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead: Transfer to a flour dusted work surface, then knead for 8 to 10 minutes. Add more flour as needed if the dough becomes too sticky.</li>
        <li>Parbake: Grease the pizza pan with cooking spray. Spread the dough to the edges of a pan. Parbake the crust for 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the oven, then add sauce and toppings.</li>
        <li>Finish Baking: Return the pizza to the oven and bake until the crust is lightly browned.</li> 
    </ol>
